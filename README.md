This is the second part of the introduction to our R Markdown tutorial. As we saw in the first part of this tutorial, Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Last time

Recall that the first part of this tutorial entailed an introduction to rMarkdown's capabilities and getting each of your personal computers to generate a default template .html file. At this point in time, you should be able to:

+ Understand the differences between R, R Studio, and rMarkdown
+ Be aware that rMarkdown has multiple capabilities
    + .html files, .pdf files, presentations, academic manuscripts
+ Be able to generate an example default .html template on your personal computer

> Is anyone not caught up with the above status points?
